# raven-cli
Raven cli is a tool that simplifies the creation of homebrew GBA roms. Project is under construction.

## Exploratory features:
### C++ Implementation of the library
Can we use c++ standard lib?

### Javascript execution
One way to simplify GBA game development would be to use one of the most used scripting languages: Javascript. We would need to implement a clear API and add hooks on the Javascript side.

Requirements:
* The javascript engine would need to have a very small footprint

Research required:
* What is the maximum memory and storage footprint the JS engine can have?
* Is it possible to implement the library in such a way that it mimicks the HTML5 canvas API? Can the JS engine handle something like this?

## TODO:
### Documentation
Another huge barrier to GBA development is the lack of documentation. Creating comprehensive documentation and publishing a website with this content will have a huge impact on ease of development.

### Contribution instructions
Document the contribution process and update milestones
